## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**  
- **Inheritance** (`SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` inherit from `BankAccount`)
- **Encapsulation** (account details and balance are stored safely)
- **Polymorphism** (different `withdraw` behavior for each account type)
- **Exception Handling** (`raise` for invalid transactions)
- **Tkinter GUI Design** (labels, buttons, input fields, and frames)
